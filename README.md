# Grade-Book-C-Programming

In this project, I created a grade book for an instructor. When the user runs the code, the program will prompt him/her to enter the designated password. In my code, I initialized the password to the string 123Password. If the user correctly enters the password, the Grade Book Menu will be displayed. The following numeric keyboard values are assigned for their respective actions:

0-	Quit the Menu 
1-	Add a student
2-	Remove a student
3-	Enter grades for students
4-	Display Name and midterm and final grades in a table format
5-	Sort based on names and list the name, midterm and final
6-	Sort based on midterm and list the name, midterm and final
7-	Sort based on final exam and list the name, midterm and final
8-	Find class mean and average for final exam
 
Once the user presses any of the following keys, he/she may be prompted to give more information depending on which task they select. If ‘0’ is pressed, the program will terminate. If any other key is pressed, an error message will be displayed and the user will be prompted to enter another choice value. After completing each task, the menu will be displayed once again for any further actions. This process will continue repeating until ‘0’ is pressed or the user manually terminates the program (i.e., closing the window, stopping the program, etc.).
